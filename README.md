# Algorithms and data structures

This repository consists of efficiency tests of **algorithms and data structures** for alghoritms classes.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are implemented using [splay tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree)
 and 
[AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)
 and tested using large (input1.txt, ~68 000 words) and very large inputs (input2.txt, ~891 000 words).
 
 Output of running test with input file name as argument results in creating log files for each dictionary. Each log file cntains information about amount of time that took insertion or query and number of elements.
 
 **in the near future
 *sorting algorithms
 *pattern searching
