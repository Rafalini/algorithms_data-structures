# Algorithms and data structures

This repository consists of analysis of **algorithms and data structures** for alghoritms classes.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are implemented using [splay tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree)
 and 
[AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)
 and tested using large (input1.txt, ~68 000 words) and very large inputs (input2.txt, ~891 000 words)
